Step 1: Initialize a New React App
Use Create React App to quickly set up a new React project. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app my-react-training-app
cd my-react-training-app

Step 2: Create Components
1. Creating a Simple Web Page Using React
Edit the src/App.js file to display a basic webpage using React components.

2. Styling the Web Page
Create a separate src/App.css file to add styles for better presentation. Import this CSS file into your src/App.js file.

3. Designing the Page Layout and Adding CSS Methods
Enhance the styling by creating a container class in src/App.css for better page layout. Apply this container class to your main content in src/App.js.

4. Using Functions and Methods
Add a state and a button click function in src/App.js to demonstrate the use of functions and state in a React component.

Step 3: Test Your App
Run your app locally using npm start and check the changes by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
